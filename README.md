## Overview

Chess-Java is a classic implementation of the game of chess using Java. This project aims to provide a robust and extensible codebase for playing chess, analyzing chess positions, and potentially integrating with other chess-related applications. It is designed with object-oriented principles in mind, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

## Features

*   **Standard Chess Rules:** Implements all the standard rules of chess, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
*   **User Interface:** A simple, intuitive user interface for playing the game (either GUI or console-based).
*   **Move Validation:** Validates each move to ensure it adheres to the rules of chess.
*   **Game State Management:** Keeps track of the game state, including piece positions, turn order, and check/checkmate status.
*   **Extensible Design:** The codebase is designed to be easily extended with new features, such as AI opponents or different game variations.
*   **Save and Load Games:** Allows users to save and load games in progress.
*   **Move History:** Maintains a history of moves made during the game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or higher.
*   Maven (for building the project).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    bash
    mvn clean install
    bash
    java -cp target/Chess-Java-{version}.jar com.example.chess.ChessConsole
        Example (GUI-based):
    *   **`Piece`:** An abstract class representing a chess piece. Subclasses include `Pawn`, `Rook`, `Knight`, `Bishop`, `Queen`, and `King`.
*   **`Board`:**  A class representing the chessboard. It manages the placement of pieces and provides methods for moving them.
*   **`Move`:**  A class representing a move made by a player. It includes the starting and ending squares, as well as any special move information (e.g., castling).
*   **`Player`:**  A class representing a player. It keeps track of the player's color and pieces.
*   **`Game`:** A class that coordinates the game logic, including turn order, move validation, and check/checkmate detection.
*   **`UserInterface`:** An interface for interacting with the user. Concrete implementations might include a console-based UI or a graphical UI.
